# Battleships

A hobbie project developed by me using C++ and OpenGL.
I challenged myself to create a simple copy of Sunless Sea, a game developed by Failbetter Studios using the Unity Engine. Only the original game assets were used and the rest of the code and gameplay itself were developed by me using just C ++ and OpenGL in Visual Studio. 

NO ASSETS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE, ONLY THE SOURCE CODE.

I challenged myself to create a simple copy of Sunless Sea, a game developed by Failbetter Studios that was originally built using the Unity Engine. Only the original game assets were used on my adaptation and the rest of the code and gameplay itself were developed by me using just C ++ and OpenGL in Visual Studio. 

Some features about the project:

- Made using C++ with OpenGL (GLFW and GLEW)
- It has a partial deferred rendering system (for lightning and other future post-processing effects that I planned to add)
- It uses a 2D lightning system with point lights and directional lights (close to what the Sunless Sea game uses)
- Sprite animations (currently only the smoke animation when moving)
- A simple user interface, it is supposed to match the original game interface (currently only the speed control widget)
- Collision detection using bounding boxes with precise pixel fetch (because the game uses 2D sprites and it's easy to detect collision this way)
- I worked on this project for 4 months during my graduation course on the university. It was a really nice experience but I had to focus on my final project to get my diploma :)
