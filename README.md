# Battleships

A hobbie project developed by me using C++ and OpenGL.
I challenged myself to create a simple copy of Sunless Sea, a game developed by Failbetter Studios using the Unity Engine. Only the original game assets were used and the rest of the code and gameplay itself were developed by me using just C ++ and OpenGL in Visual Studio. 

NO ASSETS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE, ONLY THE SOURCE CODE.

Dependencies:
- GLEW
- GLFW
- glm
- freetype
- zlib
